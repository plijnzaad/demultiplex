## This is an example for the env.sh file that is meant to be
## source'd (not executed!) before using the scripts in this directory.
## It sets the PERLLIB and PATH to use for the scripts in this repo so
## that you don't have to rely on hard-wired paths.
##
## Copy it to env.sh and adjust to needs. If all your git checkouts are
## contained in one directory (e.g. $HOME/git), just adjust variable
## gitroot below and you should be fine.
## Source (don't run) the script as
##
##  source ./env.sh
##
## prior to using the library.
